# Qwirkle-AI
Repository for the Qwirkle playing agent for CIS 530/730 at Kansas State University

## Notes
The library that allows us to connect the C# to Prolog requires (SWI-Prolog)[http://www.swi-prolog.org/] installed, as well as the Path variable set. 
The library can be found here, as well as the Github repository here.
