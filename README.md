# Qwirkle-AI
Repository for the Qwirkle playing agent for CIS 530/730 at Kansas State University

## Notes
The library that allows us to connect the C# to Prolog requires [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/) installed, as well as the Path variable set. 
The library can be found [here] (http://www.lesta.de/prolog/swiplcs/Generated/Index.aspx), as well as the Github repository [here] (https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/contrib-swiplcs).

Since the main focus of the project was the knowledge base, there are some minor bugs in the UI.

This project is open source under the GNU GPL license.
